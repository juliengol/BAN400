# Olympic Medals Shiny app

## Introduction and purpose
This app is designed to visualize Olympic Medal winners interactively. The development of the app is part of the BAN400 course at the Norwegian School of Economics. The app consists of three tabs outlining a map with the most medal-winning countries, a timeline graph over the medal development for each country and a markdown report with graphs and detailed information about the dataset.

With this app, we want the user to get an interactive experience of the Olympic medal count.

## Method and installations 
*Olympic Medals* depends on different packages to be able to run. The app is made in *Shiny*, and the specifications are mainly from this library. Additionally, a Markdown report is included as one of the tabs in the app by using the Markdown library in R. The packages transform the data and makes the app.


`install.packages("shiny")
 install.packages("ggplot2")
 install.packages("tidyverse")
 install.packages("dplyr")
 install.packages("leaflet")
 install.packages("markdown")
 install.packages("knitr")`

## How to start the app
The dataset used in the app is a combination of medals from the Winter and Summer Olympics, in addition to information about countries and geographical location of the countries. To make sure there are no duplicates, we clean the dataset before we start the necessary calculations and adjustments. 

One of the main data frames used in the app is the frame called Medal, consisting of year, country and number of medals. This dataset is further used to specify different aspects. 

The app consists of a user interface, *ui*, deciding how we want the app to look like, and a server, *server*, being the function of how to get the desired output. The server function consists of the three parameters input, output, and session. The app is opened by running `shiny::shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)`


## Input
*Olympic Medals* is made interactive, to account for different intputs. The user is free to click around in the map or choose the countries and medal type to look at the timeline for the different countries. All in all, this makes the input functions to an extent dynamic.

## Output 
The app is made flexible so that the chosen variables are shown on the screen. The graph timeline of the medal development in different countries is one of the main features. As in the graph, the user is free to click around in the map, and the map will reveal different information about the country when clicked on. In the Markdown report, we have collected some of the information from the dataset, like which country and athletes that have won the most medals.
