## Introduction

<font size="3">This report aim to present Olympic medalist winners throughout the years. This is done by creating different tables, plots and a bar animation.

The order of the report is as follows:

1. Table for total amount of medals won
2. Plot showing amount of events split into winter and summer Olympics
3. Table illustrating the most-winning countries
4. Word clouds representing the frequency of medals per country for all medals combined and for each type of medal separately
5. Plot showing amount of gold medals won per sport
6. Table for most-winning country in a single sport
7. Table illustrating the highest participation in a singe sport
8. Deep dive into the US: medals won over time
9. Table for top ten winning contestants
10. Plot showing the genders' participation over time
11. Bar animation for gold medals over the years


*NB*

The used data sets are downloaded from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games) kaggle site and contains medal winners from 1896 - 2014. We were unable to find updated datasets including the most recent Olympics. Thus, we are looking at historical data and results from the summer Olympics of 2016 are not included.</font>

## 1. Total Amount of Medals won


```{r medalss, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

## 2. Amount of Events 

|
|

```{r events, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

<font size="3">The graph shows that the summer Olympics has a higher number of sport events than the winter Olympics. Furthermore, the number of events for recent years is decreasing for summer Olympics, while it is increasing for winter Olympics.</font>

## 3. Most-Winning Countries

## 4. Word Clouds {.tabset}


```{r word cloud code, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

### Combined
<font size="3">This plot illustrates all medals combined:</font> 

```{r Combined, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

          random.order = FALSE)
```

<font size="3">From the word cloud, we see that the US is the most winning nation, and that their lead in number of medals is substantial.</font> 

|
|
|

### Gold
<font size="3">This plot illustrates gold medals:</font> 
```{r Gold, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

wordcloud(words = df.medals$country,
          freq = df.medals$Gold,
          colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"),

```

<font size="3">The US has a considerable larger number of gold medals compared to the rest of the countries.</font> 

|

### Silver
<font size="3">This plot illustrates silver medals:</font> 
```{r Silver, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}

          colors = brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"),
          random.order = FALSE)
```

<font size="3">Compared to gold and silver medals, the frequency of bronze medals is more even among the different countries.</font> 

|

|

## 5. Gold Medals per Sport

|
|

```{r events1, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


df.ol[, c(1,3)] %>% 
  ggplot(aes(fct_infreq(sport), fill=sport)) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  xlab("Sports") + 
  ylab("Gold medals") +
  coord_flip() +
    ggtitle("Total Amount of Gold Medals per Sport") 

  
```

<font size="3">Aquatics, Athletics and Rowing have the highest amounts of gold medals. Roque, jeu de paume, basque pelota and water motorsports have very few gold medals.</font> 

|
|
|

## 6. Most Winning Country in a Single Sport

```{r most winning country, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df.ol %>%
  count(event, country) %>%
  group_by(event) %>%
  mutate(totals = sum(n),                       # Finding the number of medals 
         percent_Medals = n/sum(n)) %>%         # per country sorted by events
  arrange(desc(percent_Medals)) %>%             # counting the total number of
  filter(n> 200) %>%                            # medals and calculating the percentage
  kbl(caption = "Table: Most Winning Country in a Single Sport",
      col.names = c('Event', 'Country', 'Medals won', 'Total number of medals', '%'),
      align = "llccc",
      digits = 3) %>% 
  kable_material(c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```
<font size="3"> _The table shows which country that has won the most medals in a single sport **percentage wise** compared to the total amount of medals given._

The US has won the most medals in a single sport, which is Basketball. In this sport, they account for 42,6% of the medals.</font> 

|
|
|

## 7. Highest Participation in a Single Sport 

```{r participation, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

df.ol %>%
  group_by(country, sport) %>%
  summarise(events = n_distinct(event)) %>%      # counting the number of events
  arrange(desc(events)) %>%                      # arranging in descending order
  head() %>%
  kbl(caption = "Table: Country with the Highetst Participation in a Single Sport",
  col.names = c('Country', 'Sport', 'Number of Events'),
  align = "llc") %>% 
  kable_material(c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```
<font size="3"> _Score given in absolute numbers._

The US participates the most in a single sport, which is Wrestling. 

Not surprisingly, Norway is the country with the highest participation in skiing.</font>  

|
|
|

## 8. Deep Dive into the US:

<font size="3">Since the US has won the most medals both overall and in a single sport (percentage wise), and also represents the country with the highest participation in a single sport, a deep dive is interesting. The following plot illustrates the US medal development over time.</font> 

|
|

```{r, plot over US, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df.us <- df.ol %>% 
  filter(country == "United States") %>% 
  select(c(medal, year, season)) %>%
  group_by(year, medal) %>% 
  summarise(n_medal = n()) %>%                      
  complete(medal,year)


# finding the year with the most medals won to set a limit on the y axis.
most_medals <- max(df.us$n_medal, na.rm = TRUE)


# plotting the animation
df.us %>% 
  ggplot(aes(year,n_medal,color=medal,group=medal)) + 
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, most_medals)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Number of Medals") + 
  xlab("Year") + 
  ggtitle("Olympic Medals", subtitle = "United States, The US") + 
  transition_reveal(year)

```

<font size="3">There is a somewhat similar pattern for the different types of medals.
Gold medals are often won in a greater number than bronze and silver. 

The plot also illustrates:

* Peak in 1905
* A higher variety in the number of medals won from 1980</font> 

|

## 9. Most Winning Contestant 

```{r contestant, echo=FALSE,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
indiv_medals <- df.ol %>%                   # creating a data frame for medals
  group_by(athlete,sport) %>%               # per contestants, and another where
  summarise(medals = n())                   # medals is sorted by descending order

indiv_medals <- data.frame(indiv_medals)
sort_indiv_medals <- indiv_medals[order(-indiv_medals$medals),]

      align = "llcc") %>% 
  kable_material(c("striped", "hover", "condensed"))

```

<font size="3">The table shows that Michael Phelps is the most winning athlete, with 22 medals. Both Ole Einar Bjørndalen and Bjørn Dæhlie are among the top winners, with respectively 13 and 12 medals each. 

_(Anno 2020 Pelphs has a total of 28 Olympic medals, still reigning as most winning athlete)_</font>

|

## 10. Participation Development by Gender

|
|

<font size="3">Like other parts of society, the Olympic games restricted female participation for quite some time. The following plot will demonstrate the genders' participation development over the years.</font> 

```{r gender, echo=FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height= 6}
# Olympic medals by gender for winter and summer combined
df.ol %>% 
  count(year, gender) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(Percent = n/sum(n)*100) %>%                 # sorting by percentage
  arrange(desc(Percent)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = Percent, color = gender)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(minor_breaks = seq(min(df.ol$year) , max(df.ol$year), 4), 
                     breaks = seq(min(df.ol$year), max(df.ol$year), 4)) +
  labs(title = 'Olympic Medals by Gender', color = 'Gender', 
       subtitle = 'Percentage of Medals Won by Each Gender') + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

<font size="3">From 1900, female participation started rising. However, it would take almost 96 years before each gender would represent about 50% of the events each.</font>
